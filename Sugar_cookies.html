			Sugar cookies are my favorite, especially cutting out all sorts of different shapes. Your kids can even help you with this recipe. They can last for a little over a week before they become stale, so you can take them on trips. I used to take them on hiking trips. It's like buying prepackaged cookies from Costco, but so much more fun!

		</div>
		<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li> 1 small egg </li>
			<li> 1 tablespoon soymilk (unsweetened, original, or vanilla)</li>
			<li> 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
			<li> 1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour </li> 
			<li> 3/4 teaspoon baking powder </li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li> 1/2 cup coconut oil </li>
			<li> 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional) </li>
		</ul>

		<ol> 
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 F.</li>
			<li> Using either an electronic mixer or a whisk, beat the sugar and the coconut oil until it is smooth. The sugar may not be completely dissolved by that's okay. </li>
			<li> Beat in the egg, soymilk, and (if you want more flavor) the vanilla extract. Depending on how sweet you want your cookies, use unsweetened soymilk for less sweetness, use original for some sweetness, or use vanilla for extra sweetness. </li>
			<li> Pour the flour, baking powder, and salt into another large bowl. Mix thoroughly.</li>
			<li> Slowly add the flour mixture into the wet ingredient mixture and mix thoroughly until it is blended together into dough. </li>
			<li> Completely wrap the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li> Remove the dough from the refrigerator. You can either roll out all the dough at once or work with it in chunks. (It's easier to roll it out in chunks.) With whatever method you prefer, use a roller to roll the dough out until its 1/2 cm thick. Use a 2-3 in cookie cutter to cut the dough and roll up the excess. Use the excess to cut more cookies, but if there's too little less, I would suggest rolling it into a ball and flattening it to make a round cookie.</li>
			<li>On a nonstick baking tray, spray with oil until the bottom is coated and place the cookies about 1 inch apart from each other.</li>
			<li> Put the trays in the oven. Bake the top rack for 5 minutes and bake the middle rack for 8 minutes.</li>
			<li> Once finished baking, set aside to cool. Then enjoy!</li>
