			My mom used to bake me these cakes for my birthday every year when I was a child since I could not eat the cakes sold in bakeries due to my dairy allergy. I'd always buy icing from Ralphs or Albertsons (Betty Crocker Cake Icing and Pillsbury Frosting) for more flavor and to make it look more like a cake. It tastes wonderful just by itself as well!

			<p2> Ingredients: </p2>

		<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li> 8 eggs </li>
			<li> 1 cup granulated white sugar</li>
			<li> 1/2 cup oil </li>
			<li> 2 cups all-purpose flour minus 4 tablespoons</li> 
			<li> 3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
			<li> 1 cup of water </li>
			<li> 4 teaspoons cornstarch </li>			
		</ul>

			<li> Separate the 8 eggs in egg whites and egg yolks. Make sure the egg whites are in a large bowl. </li>
			<li> Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
			<li> Using an electronic whisk, beat the egg whites. As it it is whisking, slowly add in the sugar and the cream of tartar. Beat until there are stiff peaks </li> 
			<li> In a medium sized bowl, mix together the cornstarch and the flour. (This is a substitute for cake flour. If you would like, you could use 2 cups of cake flour.)</li>
			<li> In the bowl with the egg yolks, add the water and the oil, and thoroughly beat the ingredients together. </li>
			<li> Slowly add the flour mixture into the wet ingredients bowl by sifting the mixture into the bowl.</li>
			<li> Carefully fold the beaten egg whites into the batter just enough that they mix. Too much mixture can cause the cake to not be as fluffy. </li>
			<li> Pour the batter into an aluminum nonstick cake pan.</li>
			<li> Immediatly put the cake into the oven so the batter does not lose the bubbles that allow the cake to puff up. </li>
			<li> Bake for about 45 to 55 min, or until the toothpick test comes out clean. (Poke a toothpick or a chopstick into the cake and if it comes out without any batter sticking to it, the cake should be done.)</li>
			<li> Once finished baking, take it out and flip it upside down onto a cutting board or a large plate (anything works really) to allow it to cool. </li> 
			<li> Icing and frosting is optional, but frosting the cake is the best part! </li>
