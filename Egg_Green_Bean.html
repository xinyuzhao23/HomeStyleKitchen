		<ul>
			<li> 3/4 teaspoon salt </li>
			<li> 4 eggs </li>
			<li> 1/2 plastic bag of green beans</li>
			<li> 3/4 small bowl of water </li> 
			<li> 2 teaspoons of oil </li>
		</ul>

		<ol> 
			<li> Pinch off the ends of the green beans and snap them in half. This allows the beans to cook more evenly as the surface area is increased. Rinse the beans.</li>
			<li> Crack all four eggs into a small or medium sized bowl. Evenly sprinkle in the 1/4  teaspoon of salt and using either a whisk or a pair of chopsticks, beat the eggs until they're well mixed, a dark pastel yellow color. </li>
			<li> Using a nonstick pan, pour in the 2 teaspoons of oil, and turn the stove onto high. Let the oil sit for a minute on the stove to heat it. Half a minute in, pick up the pan and swirl the oil around in the pan to coat the entire bottom surface. Once the oil is heated, pour in the beaten eggs and use a wooden spatula to scramble them. However unlike actual scrambled eggs, turn the eggs in away that allows the egg to stay as one solid, everwhere evenly cooked. Before the it completely sets, remove the egg and place it back in its original bowl.</li>
			<li>With the stove still on high, add the green beans about three seconds. Add half a teaspoon of salt and stir-fry it for another five seconds. </li>
			<li> Pour in the water and set the stove to medium-high heat before placing the lid on the pan. Allow the beans to simmer until ALMOST all the water is gone, turning the beans every two minutes to distribute the heat more evenly. </li>
			<li> Once almost all the water is gone, check the texture of the beans using the spatula. If the beans can be split in half easily, then turn the heat the low and add in the eggs. Stir fry for another twenty seconds. If not, then add just a little bit of water to cover the bottom of the pan again and continue to simmer. Then repeat this step.</li>
			<li>Make sure to immediatly take the pan off the stove. Serve immediatly.</li>
