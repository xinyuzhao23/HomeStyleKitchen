			These aren't normal chocolate chip cookies. They're made from almond flour and the special flour gives these cookies a unique taste. It also causes the cookies not to flatten as much as normal chocolate chip cookies, but the interesting shape is what sets the cookies apart. Cookies made without any chocolate chips using this kind of flour tastes great as well. Just add in half the amount chocolate chips listed after you finish making the ordinary cookies. As a disclaimer, this is an altered version of a recipe I found on the back of an almond flour package to make the recipe dairy free.
