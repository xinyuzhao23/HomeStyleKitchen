			New York Steak isn't just for parties and get-togethers. My family and I eat them for family lunches and dinners or whenever we want. You don't even have to have a fancy grill to make it. A pan (preferably non-stick or heavy metal) and oil is all you need. Just be careful not to burn it.

			<li> Place each steak on the a tray or a plate for seasoning. Then on each side of each steak, sprinkle 3 teaspoons of salt and 3 teaspoons of pepper. Using a salt grinder and pepper grinder is preferable, but not necessary. </li>
			<li> Let the steak sit for about 20 minutes to let it soak in the flavor. </li>
			<li> Coat the pan with oil. </li>
			<li> Once the oil is heated, put in the steak on one of its narrow sides. Cook for 5 minutes on high heat. Flip onto other narrow side and let it cook for another 5 minutes. </li>
			<li> Flip onto broad side. If you want well done, cook for 10 minutes. If you want medium to medium-well, cook for 8 minutes. Flip it over and repeat. </li>
			<li> Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the rest of the steaks (or as many steaks as you'd like).</li>
			<li> Serve immediatly. It is suggested to have some salt and pepper mixture on the side of the plate for flavor. </li>
