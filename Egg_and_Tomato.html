			Whether made from left-overs or from scratch, this simple dish can provide one full meal for three people. Depending on the amount of rice you put in, you can alter the amount of each ingredient to cook for even more people. If you have nothing in your refrigerator to cook a full-course meal, just whip up this dish. Just remember to eat a little bit of vegetables on the side. Sliced cucmumbers work the best! Simple and clean.

		<ul>
			<li> 3 medium sized tomatoes </li>
			<li> 1/4 teaspoon salt </li>
			<li> 4 eggs </li>
			<li> 1 small bowl of water </li> 
			<li> 2 teaspoons of oil </li>

		<ol> 
			<li> Chop up the green onion and put them to the side of the cutting board. </li>
			<li> Crack all four eggs into a small or medium sized bowl. Evenly sprinkle in the 1/4  teaspoon of salt and using either a whisk or a pair of chopsticks, beat the eggs until they're well mixed, a dark pastel yellow color. </li>
			<li> Using a nonstick pan, pour in the 2 teaspoons of oil, and turn the stove onto high. Let the oil sit for a minute on the stove to heat it. Half a minute in, pick up the pan and swirl the oil around in the pan to coat the entire bottom surface. Once the oil is heated, pour in the beaten eggs and use a wooden spatula to scramble them. However unlike actual scrambled eggs, turn the eggs in away that allows the egg to stay as one solid, everwhere evenly cooked. Before the it completely sets, remove the egg and place it back in its original bowl.</li>
			<li>With the stove still on high, add the chopped green onions and stir-fry until fragrant, about half a minute. </li>
			<li> Add in the rice. Quickly poor in the 1/2 bowl of water and begin using the spatula to separate the rice. I would suggest using the spatula to press down on the large chunks of rice to separate it. Stir-fry the rice for four minutes.</li>
			<li> Add in the eggs and stir-fry everything for another two minutes.</li>
			<li>Make sure to immediatly take the pan off the stove. Serve immediatly.</li>
