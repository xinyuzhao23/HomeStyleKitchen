			This dish is one of my favorites and it is perfect for dinner parties and barbeques. It's simple to make, and the grill can be replaced with an oven preheated to 420 F. Meat eaters love them, and little kids love them too. Just be careful to not burn your hands or mouth.

			<li> Cut the meat into short stripes, about 1 cm thick and three 5 cm long. Put them in a large bowl.</li>
			<li> Chop the red onion into thin slices and using your hands, mix it up with the lamb pieces. </li>
			<li> Season the meat by adding in the salt, pepper, and cumin and once again mix it up. </li>
			<li>Now thread the lamb onto the skewers carefully. Depending on your grill, enough exposed skewer for you to hold as well as use as support on the grill. </li>
			<li> Prepare the grill by lining the bottom with charcoal and lighting it with a match. Wait until most of the fire has died out a little before using it. </li>
			<li> Place ten skewers on the grill and sprinkle on some cumin. Let them sit until the bottom is dark brown and thoroughly cooked before flipping them. Repeat for the otherside. Once it is cooked, remove and put on a plate. </li>
			<li>Repeat for the rest of the skewers. These should be eaten immediatly after grilled. They are best served hot.</li>
